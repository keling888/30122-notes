        "A good data visualization helps us to see patterns and trends in our data that we might not have noticed otherwise. It also helps us to communicate our findings to others.\n",
        "\n",
        "You'll sometimes see these referred to as \"Exploratory Data Analysis\" and \"Explanatory Visualizations\". The former is about finding patterns in your data, the latter is about communicating those patterns to others.\n",
        "\n",
        "Many of the tools are the same, but you may find that an interactive tool is better for exploring your data, while a crisp graphic with a clear message is better for communicating your findings. This is not a hard and fast rule of course, plenty of great interactive visualizations exist that serve the purpose of letting your audience explore complex datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Before You Start (Explanatory Visualizations)\n",
        "\n",
        "Unless you're using a quick and dirty plot to explore your data, you'll want to have your data as clean as possible, in a format that is easy to work with.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generally speaking, you'll want to have your data in a tabular format, with one row per observation and one column per variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "You might use a SQL query or Pandas to get your data into this format, and then have the functions or programs that generate your visualizations read from that file.\n",
        "\n",
        "When considering the full pipeline (extraction, cleaning, matching, etc.) an visualization should be a terminal step in the pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "This will allow you to work on it independently of the rest of your data processing, and also to easily update your visualizations as your data changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you're building an explanatory visualization, you'll want to have a clear message in mind before you start.\n",
        "Ask yourself these questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "* What is the story I want to tell?\n",
        "* Who is the audience I'm trying to reach?\n",
        "* What kinds of mistakes might that audience make when interpreting my visualization?\n",
        "\n",

        "## Data Viz Best Practices\n",
        "\n",
        "### Keep your \"story\" and audience in mind\n",
        "\n",
        "There's a good chance you have a lot of interesting data, but data visualization is rarely the place to show it off.\n",
        "\n",
        "By keeping your story or key question in mind, you can usually find 1-3 visualizations that tell the story best.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider the famous \"hockey stick\" graph.\n",
        "It is a very simple graph, but it was the most effective way to communicate the key message of the report.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Simpler is usually better\n",
        "\n",
        "It is easy to get lost in making all kinds of wild visualizations modern tools offer: a network analysis graph, a 3D scatter plot, a map with multiple translucent layers showing ten different variables overlaid.\n",
        "\n",
        "Again, with your audience in mind, consider that most people can interpret a simple bar graph or line graph fairly well, but a radar chart or hierarchical treemap are going to be suited to a more technical audience.\n",
        "\n",
        "Even with technical audiences, having a simple graph that shows the key message is often better than a complex graph that shows everything.\n",
        "You can always have a secondary visualization that shows more detail for those that wish to explore further.\n",

        "### Reduce \"chart junk\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Chart junk is any visual element that is not directly related to the data. This includes:\n",
        "\n",
        "* 3D effects & shadows\n",
        "* Gradients\n",
        "* All extraneous lines including gridlines, tick marks, and axes\n",
